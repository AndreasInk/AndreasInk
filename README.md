Working on Vito and Cerebellia!

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andreas a university student and software dev looking to improve the world, especially in the health/tech sphere, with apps, ML models, and products.

When my Dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's I built an app to help him manage his disease. As my Aunt developed freezing of gait, I developed an app based on research to better coordinate gait.

In the mist of online school and coding, my neck began to hurt so I developed an app that uses AirPods' motion sensor to alert of bad posture.

Entering into lockdown, I joined a team to develop an exposure notification app to alert people of possible exposures.

When I see a problem, I strive to fix it.
